# Catalog

Catalog is a list of all imported tables, from source and target databases, and a place where we set meta properties as well. 
In a list, along every table you can select PREVIEW or EDIT button. Clicking the first, we can see sample data in table, and second opens a form, where in different tabs, a table metadata is defined.
