### Jobs

When we have set everything Data Merlin needs, it is time to generate a job, which the execution engine will use. This is done in two steps:
Click on a ‘Validate job’ button and if result is like in example below, you are good to go. In case of errors, list will be populated with them- they are warnings and fatal errors. If any of the fatal errors occurs, a ‘Create new job’ button will be disabled, so first make sure you don’t have any of them.
